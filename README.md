The project introduces a user-friendly Arduino Uno-based oscilloscope designed for simplicity, portability, and cost-effectiveness, offering advantages over traditional oscilloscopes. The project utilizes an Arduino microcontroller to provide a practical platform for signal visualization, graphically indicating changes in signal voltage over time. The oscilloscope displays various signals, including impulse, sine, cos, exponential, ramp, step, and square signals, using an OLED display for clear and precise readings. The paper emphasizes the practical aspects of signal display and highlights the user-friendly design and cost-effectiveness of the Arduino-based oscilloscope. It concludes that the project enhances understanding of signal recognition and display, offering a valuable and convenient alternative to larger, more expensive oscilloscopes.
